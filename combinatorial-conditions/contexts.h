// A context is a finite collection of data associated with every node in a binary
// tree. The idea is that, given the context of a node, we are able to decide if
// it has a left or right child, and, if so, produce the contexts for those children.
// Thus, given the context of the root node, we are able to generate an arbitrarly 
// large tree. See gen_tree.h for generating a tree from a root context.
